## 🧠 About Me

I'm the kind of person who stares at a system and thinks:  
*"How can I break this — and then make it bulletproof?"* 😎

I'm **Fragmablast** — cybersecurity enthusiast, ethical hacker, and full-stack developer with a passion for system hardening, red teaming, and open-source security tools. I specialize in identifying vulnerabilities before the bad guys do — and writing clean, scalable code to eliminate them.

My philosophy? **Hack to protect. Build to empower.**
